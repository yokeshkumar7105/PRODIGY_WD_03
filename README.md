This repository contains task number 3 which is been done during my internship at <b>Prodigy Infotech</b>

Built a tic-tac-toe web application, using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. By implementing functions to handle user clicks, track game state, and check for winning conditions and created an interactive and engaging tic-tac-toe game. With these technologies and functionalities, users can play against each other or against an AI opponent.
